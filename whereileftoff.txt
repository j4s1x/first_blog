June 6 2017
created index page and a couple test articles.  Want to make it so that it only shows first say...
50 characters of the post.  In order to read full article must click link to go to article page
and it will display it in full.  Also want it so that only 5 posts are displayed on the front page
and that the rest go into a seperate web page as "archives"
